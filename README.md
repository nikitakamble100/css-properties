##Editors

So the first thing you'll need is an editor to edit your jazz. There's tons of options out there.

. Notepad/TextEdit (that's right, the stupid thing that comes on your computer) - This is about as basic as you can get. It's totally okay if you want to use this, but I recommend one of the editors below just so you can see code highlighting (which will help you out later on). But, if you want to be a purist, this'll work just fine.
Visual Studio Code - This is what I typically use. It's open source and has TONS of extensions available.

. Atom - This is another very customizable option, with a huge plugin library and open source so it's always being improved.
. Sublime Text 3 - This is a pretty popular option, and for good reason. Very clean interface. Once you can navigate it (learning curve isn't that big), it's pretty dreamy. Like your face.
. CodePen Projects - This is an in-browser code editor, so you can code directly within the web browser, no downloads required. :)
. Glitch - This is another in-browser code editor. It is meant for larger projects, but it's nice to not have to download anything!
. Notepad++ - This is just one step up from Notepad. But it's pretty dece. Code highlighting is in it, and nothing else too fancy, which is what I like about it.
